<h3>WOOD CUSTOM CORNERS THEME</h3>
<hr />

<p><strong>Only suitable for Moodle 1.9 upwards!</strong></p>

<p>This theme is one working proof of concept of two
amazing <strong>CSS</strong> features built within Moodle:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Inheriantce between themes:</strong> This theme has defined
the standard "<strong>wood</strong>" theme as its parent so,
automatically, all the styles/modifications/improvements from that theme will be available and displayed here.</li>
<li><strong>Custom corners:</strong> Since Moodle 1.9 is really easy to
build new themes whose main boxes (header, footer, blocks, contents...)
are enclosed by rounded boxes, generating a cool effect.</li>
</ul>

<p>This theme is based on Moodle's <strong>Standard, Wood and Custom Corners 2</strong> themes.</p>

<p>To work properly, both Moodle <strong>Standard and Wood themes must 
be present and unaltered</strong> in the "theme" directory.</p>

<p>In this way custom themes are not "left behind" by Moodle upgrades.</p>

<p>For any suggestion, fix or comment about this theme, please, start a discussion
in the <a target="_blank" href="http://moodle.org/mod/forum/view.php?id=46">"Themes Forum"</a>.</p>

<p>Special thanks to <strong>Urs Hunkler, <a href="http://www.unodo.de" target="_blank">unodo</a></strong>
for his continue support and superb custom corners implementation for Moodle.</p>

<p>That's all, moodlers. Enjoy and ciao, stronk7!</p>
